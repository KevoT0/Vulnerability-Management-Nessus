# Vulnerability Management (Nessus)

# Description
This project is all about Vulnerability assessment, in this project the use of VMware workstation with Windows 10 VM, finally Nessus a well-known vulnerability scanner will be used conduct the vulnerability scan. This portfolio will give a step-by-step process on how the windows system was made vulnerable and how the scan was conducted, what was found during the scan and the remediation strategy that was in place to make the system secure. 
<br />

# Utilities and Enviroment Used
- <b>Windows OS</b> 
- <b>VMWare workstation</b>

# Walkthrough
<h2>Setting up the network</h2>

After logging in to Nessus Vulnerability scanner. I found the different Vulnerability scanning options but i chose the basic scan. to practice Vulnerability scanning and managemnet

Log into the windows VM figure out the IP Address and ping the IP with the host where Nessus reside to confirm they are communicating and on the same network.

Using ICMP to confirm thy can both communicate with each other see the image bellow.

<h2>Conducting the first scan</h2>

Now we can perform ICMP successfully, we will go ahead to perform our first scan in NESSUS. In the image below the details of the target machine are set which include name and IP Address

After the first scan was conducted here is the result, we got in image below. We can see the vulnerability is low, there are no serious vulnerabilities attached.

<h2>Making the Windows VM Vulnerable</h2>

To make the windows VM vulnerable we need to ensure some services are disabled. Here are the services that were disabled to allow access to the windows VM.

First, we disable remote registry following these services. Service > Remote registry > setup type (Automatic).

Secondly, user access control was disabled to ensure that the user is not notified when a software is installed on the device.

In addition to make the windows VM vulnerable a registry a file is created on Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHIN\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System called LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy with the value Data of 1. This policy in place makes the system more vulnerable.

Next a legacy software is installed, the software is an old firefox outdated software which has a lot of vulnerabilities se figure 11 and 12 on the download and installation of the software.

After installation w are inform of the vulnerability associated with the installed software. This shows that the certificate is expired which makes it vulnerable to attacks. See the image bellow.

<h2>SCANNING OF THE VULNERABLE DEVICE</h2>

Moving back to Nessus a Credential scan has been setup to scan the Windows VM. In the credential scan setup, the username and password of the windows PC is added
